Audit fields (created_by_id, created_date, etc.) ensure full traceability of invoice creation and modifications.",
  "marketing_invoiceitems": "The `marketing_invoiceitems` table contains the **line-item details of each product included in a sales invoice**. Each record is linked to a parent invoice via `invoice_id` and references a specific `product_id`. It captures the sold `qty` and unit `price`, along with the applicable tax rates—`cgst_rate`, `sgst_rate`, and `igst_rate`—which determine the GST composition based on the transaction type (intra-state or inter-state). The table also supports promotional logic through fields like `is_offer_flag` (indicating if the item is part of an offer), `is_same_product` (used in Buy X Get X schemes), `main_order_product_id` (linking offer items to their triggering product), and `offer_qty` (quantity given as a free or discounted offer). Additionally, `tcs` (Tax Collected at Source) is stored at the item level if applicable. This granular structure ensures accurate billing, tax calculation, and offer tracking per invoice.",
  "marketing_orderdispatches": "The `marketing_orderdispatches` table records **dispatch events linked to customer orders**, capturing when and how an order was prepared for delivery. Each dispatch is assigned a unique `dispatch_no` and timestamped with `date`. It is directly associated with a specific sales order via `order_id` and linked to a `truck_loading_id`, which connects it to logistics and transportation planning. The financial summary includes `total_value` (pre-GST order value), `total_gst`, and `total_amount` (inclusive of taxes), ensuring alignment with invoicing. Weight and quantity metrics are tracked in detail: `order_weight` reflects the total weight originally ordered, while `total_dispatch_weight` and `total_dispatch_qty` indicate the actual dispatched quantities; similarly, `total_offer_weight` and `total_offer_qty` capture any free or promotional items (e.g., from Buy X Get Y schemes) included in the dispatch. Audit fields (`created_by_id`, `created_date`, etc.) maintain a history of record creation and updates. This table bridges sales, warehouse, and logistics operations by documenting what was shipped, when, and in what context.",
  "marketing_orderdispatchofferitemscrate": "The `marketing_orderdispatchofferitemscrate` table tracks **crate-level details for promotional (offer) items included in a dispatch**.

Tax rates—`cgst_rate`, `sgst_rate`, and `igst_rate`—are recorded to support accurate GST calculation based on the transaction’s nature (intra- or inter-state). The table also manages **promotional logic**: `is_offer_flag` indicates if the item is an offer (e.g., free product), while `offer_qty` specifies the promotional quantity; `main_order_product_id` links offer items to the qualifying product. Fields like `is_having_offer`, `is_offer_eligible`, and `is_same_product` support complex scheme logic (e.g., “Buy X Get X” vs. “Buy X Get Y”). The `balance_count` tracks undelivered or pending order quantities, and `no_of_crates` records how many crates are needed for this item. Weight tracking is handled via `order_item_weight` (weight of ordered product) and `offer_item_weight` (weight of promotional items). Together, these fields enable precise order fulfillment, offer application, logistics planning, and partial dispatch handling.",
  "marketing_orderpayments": "The marketing_orderpayments table records payment transactions linked to customer orders and invoices.

The confirmation_status (e.g., Confirmed, Approved, Cancelled) indicates whether the payment has been verified, and reconciliation_flag marks if it has been reconciled with bank or ledger records. Payments can be tied to an invoice_id, order_id, and party_id for full traceability. The collected_by_id identifies the staff member who collected the payment (if applicable), and voucher_no provides an internal reference (e.g., a cash receipt number). Additional flags like towards_previous_system_balance indicate if the payment settles legacy dues, and cash_submitted tracks whether physical cash has been handed over for accounting. Audit fields (created_by_id, created_date, etc.) and optional remark ensure transparency and compliance in financial operations.",
  "marketing_orders": "The `marketing_orders` table serves as the **central header record for customer sales orders**, capturing essential metadata and financial summaries.
